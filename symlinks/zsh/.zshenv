# If zsh is not working properly with your dotfile configuration,
# You can quickly set up clean configs by uncommenting the line

# ZDOTDIR=/

# Zsh loads your configuration settings
# in this order:

#   $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv
#   $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
#   $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
#   $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
#   $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
